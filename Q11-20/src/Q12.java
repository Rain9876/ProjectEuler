    Problem 12

    The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be

    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

    1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

    Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

    1: 1
    3: 1,3
    6: 1,2,3,6
    10: 1,2,5,10
    15: 1,3,5,15
    21: 1,3,7,21
    28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

    We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

    What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
